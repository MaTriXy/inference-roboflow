# Experimental version of inference

## 🚀 Introducing `inference-exp` - the evolution of `inference`

At Roboflow, we’re taking a bold step toward a new generation of `inference` — designed to be faster, 
more reliable, and more user-friendly. With this vision in mind, we’re building a new library called `inference-exp`.

This is an early-stage project, and we’re sharing initial versions to gather valuable community feedback. 
Your input will help us shape and steer this initiative in the right direction.

We’re excited to have you join us on this journey — let’s build something great together! 🤝

> The `inference-exp` package **is an experimental preview** of upcoming inference capabilities.
> **🔧 What this means:**
> * Features may change, break, or be removed without notice.
> * We **do not guarantee backward compatibility** between releases.
> * We are publishing this to PyPI only **for preview and feedback purposes.**
